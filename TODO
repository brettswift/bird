6. cloud.rb:116  refactor to DDD and model objects, separate repository.
7. cli.rb:9  move to config module?
8. cli.rb:109  clean this up - too much copy/paste

10. vm.rb:18  move this to a different object, vmInfo. 
11. vapp_spec.rb:29  get off your ass and write more unit tests so we can be TDD.. maybe.
