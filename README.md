# bird

I am a command line tool to interact with VMWare vCloud Director API and to kick the Puppetlabs Puppet agent. 

I'm intended for development and to facilitate CI and CD workflows only.

The name may change one day.  Creativity isn't my strong suit.  

## Development

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:
    
    $ git clone
    $ bundle
    $ bird


## Usage
